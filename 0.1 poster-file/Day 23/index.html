                    Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the 
                    clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the 
                    strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly 
                    thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be 
                    a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses." Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to 
                    society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, 
                    he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer. [Written by MAL Rewrite] </p>
